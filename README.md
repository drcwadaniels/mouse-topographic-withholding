# mouse-topographic-withholding
This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for the experiments reported in a yet published paper tentatively titled: **Response-Inhibition Capacity of Mice is Differentially Modulated by Response Topography in Two Response-Withholding Tasks**

* For details on the analysis see the [markdown](TopographyTRModel.md) or [html](TopographyTRModel.html) versions
* To recreate the analysis download the .mat files and Jupyter Notebook/Lab file (.ipynb) and any .Rmd files for analyses conducted in R. 
* To fit the discussed mixture models see the .m files (you will need all three). Note that different versions of the mixture models are available, they are just commented out.
